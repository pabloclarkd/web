I am a data analyst and researcher with seven years of experience working in a non-governmental organization. My work has focused on different topics in education, such as gender equality in STEM, higher education economic returns and school choice in Mexico. I have also worked on several websites that use data to help students, parents and schools make evidence-based decisions about their education. 


I studied sociology and mostly learned qualitative methods like ethnography, but data analysis has become one of my favorite parts of doing research during my professional work and I especially enjoy using R to produce analysis, visualizations and dashboards. I built this site to showcase my experience and demonstrate the skills I could contribute in a new professional role.
