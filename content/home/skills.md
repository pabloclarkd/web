  - description: I used R most days in my previous role. Tasks like merging, filtering and analyzing data were part of all the projects I worked on. I also wrote scripts to replicate most of these tasks and be able to save time when I was working on recurring projects. I also know how to build basic dashboards using Shiny.

  - description: I have basic SQL skills. The projects that I worked on and were centered on web tools occasionally required me to query data and filter it, before working with it in some other software like R or Excel. I also had to be familiar with parts of the data models, as I often prepared data for other collaborators to insert or update.
