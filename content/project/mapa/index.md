subtitle: ""

summary: The School Reconstruction Map is an interactive map of schools which were damaged by the 2017 earthquakes in Mexico. The map represents the level of damage of each building and its rebuilding status at a glance. Pop-up cards for each school offer more details, such as the budget it received and how much it spent. Its goals are to increase cooperation between public and private stakeholders, enhance accountability and facilitate transparency in the rebuilding of education infrastructure.

#### Project Description

The [School Reconstruction Map](http://reconstruccion.mejoratuescuela.org/) is an interactive map of schools which were damaged by the earthquakes in Mexico in 2017. The map displays information about the level of damage and repair status of each affected building. Pop-up cards for each school offer more details, such as the budget it received and how much it spent. This tool sought to increase cooperation between public and private stakeholders, enhance accountability and facilitate transparency in the rebuilding of education infrastructure. 

#### What was my involvement in this project?

I was product owner for this project and was involved in most of its tasks. The lack of data on damaged schools was one of the biggest hurdles this project had to solve. In order to collect the data we needed to build the map's database, we built alliances with public agencies and private enterprises, in which organizations shared and analyzed the data each was producing. The resulting database consolidates inputs generated by 3 national government organisms, 12 state education agencies and 14 private organizations.


The resulting information was the first complete census of damaged schools and its rebuilding strategy and became the most reliable source of data for its monitoring. For example, its database was later the source of indicators developed by the new federal government for use by its National Reconstruction Program. As a result of its impact, this project was selected to be presented at the [2019 Paris Peace Forum](https://parispeaceforum.org/en/) and I was one of the two project members that assisted.
