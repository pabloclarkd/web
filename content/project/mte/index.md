#### Project Description

[Mejora Tu Escuela](https://mejoratuescuela.org) is an online platform that provides citizens with information about school performance. It has a profile for every school in Mexico and displays information like its location, enrollment, teacher characteristics and performance in national standardized testing. The site allows parents to search for schools of their choice, to grade and to comment on some of the school's services.

#### What was my involvement in this project?

IMCO began this project in 2013. After I joined IMCO in 2015, I mostly worked in Mejora Tu Escuela for several years until I became responsible for the project as a whole. At first I was involved in dealing with the site's users and writing content. Afterwards I began to work with its data, dealing with tasks like finding available sources, processing and using them in analysis, and preparing them to be inserted into the site's database. Later on, I began to use Google Analytics to monitor site usage, track objectives and implement changes and additions to the site.
