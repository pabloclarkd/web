#### Publication Description

This is the first of two reports that discuss distance-learning during the pandemic in the Mexican educational system. This document takes international estimates of learning and attendance during distance schooling and applies them to data on the Mexican education system. Its goal is to outline the possible effects and long-term consequences of a generation of students who learned less or dropped out of school entirely.
