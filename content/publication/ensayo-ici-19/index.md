#### Project Description

This short essay was published as part of IMCO's 2019 flagship publication of an international competitiveness index. This publication explores the connections between inequality, educational outcomes and economic competitiveness, and offers some policy suggestions aimed to break the intergenerational cycle of low education achievements and increased barriers in professional trajectories  

#### What was my involvement in this publication?
