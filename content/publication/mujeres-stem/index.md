#### Publication Description

In Mexico some college majors are popular only among men or among women. In academic majors such as nutrition studies, social work and curriculum design, three out of every four students are women. In other study programs, like mechanical engineering and construction engineering, nine out of every ten students are men. This report describes how the gender gap in STEM subjects and occupations begins in childhood and grows until it comes to shape women’s professional careers.

#### What was my role in this publication?

I was the main author of this research report, with contributions from my supervisor at IMCO, in which I used ten years of labor market data from a household survey and college enrollment figures from administrative records.
