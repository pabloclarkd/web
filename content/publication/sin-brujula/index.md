#### Publication Description

This is the second research report in the *Educación in pandemia* project and explores the programs developed to measure student learning during the return to in-person schooling and to address its immediate effects on attendance and learning outcomes. It compares Mexico's strategy with alternatives developed by other education systems around the world, especially in Latin America, and offers suggestions to improve on them.
